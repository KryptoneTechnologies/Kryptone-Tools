Kryptone Tools - Advanced Penetration Testing Toolkit

Kryptone Tools is a comprehensive, web-based penetration testing suite designed for educational purposes and professional security assessments. It consolidates a wide array of security tools into a unified platform, enabling efficient and methodical testing workflows.
Core Functions
The platform is organized into several key functional areas:
1. Reverse Shell Generator
Reverse Shell Generator
Instantly creates and encodes payloads to establish a remote command shell on a target machine, streamlining the post-exploitation phase.2. Encode / Decode
2. Useful Linux & Windows Commands
Useful Linux & Windows Commands
Quickly access a reference of powerful commands for post-exploitation tasks, from enumerating system info to manipulating services and files.
3. SQL Injection
SQL Injection
Automates the detection and exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities, allowing you to test database security by extracting information through crafted malicious inputs.
4. Encode / Decode
Encode / Decode
A versatile utility for encoding and decoding data across multiple formats (Base64, URL, HTML, etc.), essential for obfuscating payloads and interpreting captured data.
5. Password Tools
Password Tools
Generate custom wordlists, analyze password strength, and crack hashes using various algorithms to assess the resilience of authentication systems.
6. CVE Zero-Day Tracker
CVE Zero-Day Tracker
Monitor and search the latest CVE vulnerabilities and zero-day exploits, keeping you informed of emerging threats that need immediate patching or testing.
7. Payload Generator
Payload Generator
Craft and customize malicious payloads for various exploit frameworks (like Metasploit), complete with encoding options to evade detection by security controls.
8. Breach Beacon
Breach Beacon
A proactive monitoring tool that checks if corporate emails or domains have been involved in known data breaches, highlighting credential exposure risks.
